                <td>Mayday evolved from So Band which was formed by Ashin, Monster and the first drummer Qian You Da (錢佑達) in 1995 while they were studying in The Affiliated Senior High School of National Taiwan Normal University(師大附中). They were later joined by Masa and Stone, who were attending the same school. After graduation, the members went to different universities but continued to perform in pubs and eateries. They were also actively involved in promoting the growing rock music trend in Taiwan.[3] In 1997, the band registered under the moniker Mayday[1] in order to join the Formoz Festival (野台開唱). This would become the official name of the musical crew.</td>

                <th>Early years (1997–1999)</th>
                <td>Shortly after participating in the Formoz Festival (野台開唱), the band began to actively send demo tapes to various record companies in the hope of sealing a record deal. Their demo impressed Rock Records executive Jonathan Lee (李宗盛)[4] who described them as "the ones who would usher in the sound of the future".[4]

As a result, they signed their first record deal with Rock Records in 1998. In the same year, they also took part in the release of the Taiwan Independent Compilation Album 《ㄞ國歌曲》by indie music label TCM (角頭音樂) which included their first studio recording Motor Rock《軋車》.[5] In June 1998, they also released Embrace《擁抱》 compilation album for which they took on most of the songwriting, production and recording duties.[6]

In 1999, after their third drummer Robert from Loh Tsui Kweh Commune had left (the second drummer was Chen Yung-chang 陳泳錩,[7] the ex-member from a band called "whynot" (disbanded)), Guan You (冠佑) joined the band and completed Mayday. They went on to release their first full-length studio album Mayday's First Album《第一張創作專輯》under Rock Records on 7 July 1999. Their debut received critical acclaim, and they gained a following in Taiwan. It went on to sell more than 300,000 copies, a considerable feat for a new band in the then pessimistic and saturated music industry.[4] They were also nominated for the 11th Golden Melody Awards under the category of Best Band (十一届金曲獎最佳演唱團體獎).[8] The tracks Peter and Mary 《志明與春嬌》and Embrace 《擁抱》 also caught on among the youth, and became the top songs on the KTV Chart. Peter and Mary was one of the top ten songs of the year according to the Association of Music Workers in Taiwan (中華音樂人交流協會). In fact, Peter and Mary has been acknowledged by Ashin as the "song that brought them from the north of Taiwan to the south, allowing everyone to recognize Mayday." On 28 August, they held their first large-scale performance called The 168th Performance 「第168場演唱會」, cementing their position as one of the rising bands in Taiwan.</td>

In 2001, Mayday worked for the first time, on a movie soundtrack and accompanying score for the movie Migratory Bird 《候鳥》which starred Rene Liu and Huang Pin Yuan. Two months later, Mayday released their third album People Life Ocean Wild 《人生海海》, sales of which hit more than 35,000 copies after just a month.</td>

This led to their farewell concerts titled Where Are You Going? 「你要去哪裡」from 18 August 2001 to 1 September 2001. Tuo La Ku and Japanese rock band Glay were special guests at the concert. Memorably for many fans, guitarist Stone chose the occasion to propose to his girlfriend and the proposal song was also included in the live concert album. In November 2001, the members temporarily disbanded with Masa going into the military, Stone heading to England to learn production techniques and Guan You to Los Angeles in order to hone his drumming skills. Meanwhile, Monster and Ashin remained in Taiwan with Rock Records, taking up recording and production duties for other label mates.</td>

In conjunction with their new album and sponsored by Le Tea, they also held Born to Love 《五月天 le power 天使，為愛而生新歌演唱會》 concerts around Taiwan. Tickets to these concerts were packaged within the first edition of the Born to Love albums, and fans formed lines overnight in order to get their hands on the actual tickets that allowed them entrance into the concerts.

Furthermore, Mayday's concerts at Taipei Arena was the first to end with power outages that kept Mayday from continuing to perform encores, as they were already paying heavy fines for performing after 11 pm at the venue.

At the Taipei concerts, the Kaohsiung concert stop was announced. It was held on 5 December 2009 at the National Stadium (Kaohsiung), which would allow Mayday to hold a "55555 people" concert.[16] It was Mayday's first concert at the stadium.</td>
